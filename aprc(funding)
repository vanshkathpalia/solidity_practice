/* 
my approach ->
1- to make a struct, parameter containing necessary condition to add a fund raise
-> problem mincont and fund actually raise needs to be compaired

2- problem with receiver function, how to not to send this money to manager if 50% votes are not there

3- voting funtion how to create ???

4- how to send back contributor's amount back in case of any failure ???

i was right about the constructor but it will update many parameter and take deadline and target before delopying

/* 
correct approach ->
1- to make no struct instead many const declared 
2- what about multiple funds there is should have had a event struct... ???
